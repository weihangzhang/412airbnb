Using Python 2.7.10

The file names for all three algorithms are: 'decisionTree.py', 'neural.py' and 'naivebyes.py'. 'neural_2_hlayer.py' is the 2 hidden layers version of neural network implementation.

In order to run these files, you need to install numpy library on your machine.

cd into folder and do: 'python' + file_name to run the file. All the files are ready to run with our best parameters. 

The outputs are in the .txt files named: decisionTreeOutput.txt, naive_byes_out.txt and neural_out.txt
